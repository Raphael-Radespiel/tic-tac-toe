- Add a turn number (to check for wins) and make it alternate between players that start
- Add the win condition check

Explain the script logic to myself over here:

FUNCTIONS:
SetUpSelection() -> Resets the display, changes the display class so it has appropriate style,
                    resets the gameMode variables (is this appropriate for this function?) and gets selection Mode(?)
SetUpGame() -> Resets the display, changes the display class so it has appropriate style, 
                sets canvas, appends it and runs gameplay loop
ResetDisplay() -> Makes it so The game display section has nothing inside of it

TODO: checkout github psge canvas style to see why its not centered with my new code refactoring
